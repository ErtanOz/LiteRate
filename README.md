# LiteRate
LiteRate is a program implementing birth-death models within a Bayesian framework to estimates diversification dynamics from cultural data.

The main methods are described in [Gjesfjeld et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227579), [Silvestro et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1017/pab.2019.23), and [Koch et al. in prep](link). 

Detailed tutorials demonstrating the use of the software package are available [here](link to PDFs of the course).

### Requirements
LiteRate is written in Python v.3 and requires 
the libraries numpy and scipy. 
Source files and installers are available [here](https://numpy.org) and [here](https://scipy.org). 

Alternatively, you can download the requirements.txt file and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them from the terminal (UNIX systems). Note that if Python v.2 is the default version of Python in your machine you might need to use `python3` to launch the program and `pip3` to install the required libraries.
