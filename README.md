# LiteRate
LiteRate is a program implementing birth-death models within a Bayesian framework to estimates diversification dynamics from cultural occurence data. The model detects statistically-significant rate shifts in the history of the cultural population that theoretically correspond with major historical events and/or the action of evolutionary processes. 

# Restricted Models
The repository also contains some more restricted birth-death models for testing hypotheses generated by LiteRate. For now, these include DDRate (rates driven by diversity-dependent competition) and TrendRate (rates driven by exogenous trends).

# Tutorials
Detailed tutorials demonstrating the use of the software package are available [here](link to PDFs of the course).

### Requirements
LiteRate is written in Python v.3 and requires 
the libraries numpy and scipy. 
Source files and installers are available [here](https://numpy.org) and [here](https://scipy.org). 

Alternatively, you can download the requirements.txt file and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them from the terminal (UNIX systems). Note that if Python v.2 is the default version of Python in your machine you might need to use `python3` to launch the program and `pip3` to install the required libraries.
